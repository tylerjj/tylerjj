- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tylerjj/Tyler Johnston. 
- ðŸ‘€ As a recent graduate, Iâ€™m actively searching for entry level software development positions. I find front-end development to be the most rewarding work, but I'm happy to expand my horizons and work with new skills. The goal is to never stop learning.
- ðŸŒ± My portfolio site can be found at https://tylerjj.github.io. There, I've got a handful of project writeups from this most recent semester, including a course enrollment application made with React, a campus resource finder made with a team in Android Studio (Java), and a gallery of scripts from computer graphics. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: tylerj.johnston@outlook.com
