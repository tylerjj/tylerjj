- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tylerjj
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development aimed at those new to the industry from university. I find development that contains a visual component to be the most engaging, but I'm primarily interested in a workspace that is welcoming towards industry newcomers. 
- ðŸŒ± I just spent the summer dipping my toes into the topics of Unity 2D Development and 3D modeling, as well as refamiliarizing myself with web development and making my portfolio site. I'm currently taking my final three courses before I graduate: Mobile Development, Computer Graphics, and UX Development.
