- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tylerjj
- ðŸ‘€ As a recent graduate, Iâ€™m actively searching for entry level software development positions. I find development that contains a visual component to be the most engaging (web-dev, game-dev, mobile-dev, etc.), but I'm primarily interested in a workspace that is welcoming towards industry newcomers. 
- ðŸŒ± I spent the summer dipping my toes into the topics of Unity 2D Development and 3D modeling, as well as refamiliarizing myself with web development and making my portfolio site. This fall, I spent the semester working with web development in the form of React, mobile development with Android Studio and React Native, as well as learning some computer graphics fundamentals.
